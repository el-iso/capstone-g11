This tutorial will guide you through creating spheres
in unity that pulse at a frequency received from the
mongo database.

1. Create two new spheres, name one "Lungs" and one "Heart"
(or whatever you want, one will represent hearbeat, the
other will represent respiration)

1.1 Customize these spheres however you want, I changed
the Heart sphere to the material Red and Lungs to Blue.

2. Position the Camera and Spheres such that both spheres
are in view of the camera.  The settings I used were:
Camera: Pos(0,5,0), Rot(90,0,0)
Sphere1(Heart): Pos(-1,0,0)
Sphere2(Lungs): Pos(1,0,0)


3. Add a new empty gameobject (Gameobject -> Create Empty).
Name this game object "Mongo".  Add the MongoInterface.cs
script found in unity_toolbox/Assets/Aaron/MongoInterface.cs
to this object.

4. Attach BPM.cs script found in unity_toolbox/Assets/Aaron/Scripts/BPM.cs
to both spheres.  In the component menu for the BPM script,
uncheck respiration on the heart sphere and uncheck heartbeat
on the lungs sphere.  These options tell the BPM script which
data to use. If both are left checked it will default to heartbeat.

5. Select one sphere in the hierarchy, and find the BPM script you just attached.
There is a field called Mongo Container.  Drag the Mongo object you created in 
step 3 into that field. A small three colored cube should appear in the Mongo 
Container field with "Mongo" beside it.  This allows the BPM script to reference
the MongoInterface script without searching for it.
5.1 Repeat for the other sphere.

6. Run the DirectToMongo.py script found in Python_Scripts/DirectToMongo.py
in a new command prompt

7. Enter play mode. Your spheres should now be pulsing at the most recent
Beats Per Minute specified in Mongo for heartrate and respiration.
