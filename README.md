### Documentation
The documentation folder contains basic documentation for setting up a Unity project as well as setting up MongoDB.

### Unity-Toolbox
The unity_toolbox folder contains experiments done in Unity during the first half of the 2018 Spring semester.
The purpose of these experiments was to determine what is easily possible in Unity that might be useful for visualizations.

### Python Scripts
The python_scripts folder contains python scripts that were needed to complete the project such as radio receiver/transmitting, the medical data simulator, and MongoDB interfacing.

### Final Components
The final_components folder contains all of the completed visualizations, the latest build of the dashboard, and the dependencies.
All components are in Unity "packages" that can be imported into Unity.  Visualizations have "master prefabs" which can be click-and-dragged into a Unity scene.
