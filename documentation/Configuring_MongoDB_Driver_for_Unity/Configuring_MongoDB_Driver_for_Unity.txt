Prerequisites:
==================
MongoDB
Unity

1)	Open the Unity project.
2)	Import the MongoDriver.unitypackage from the "Packages" folder.
3)	Create an instance of the "Mongo" prefab from the "MongoPrefabs" folder by dragging it from the "Project" pane into the "Hierarchy" pane.  This will ensure that the "MongoInterface" script runs properly.
4)	Save the Scene and Project if a scene/project does not already exist.
5)	Open the Unity "Player Settings" (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player).
6)	An Inspector window will open on the right. Under the "Other Settings" heading and the "Configuration" sub-heading change the "Api Compatibility Level*" setting from ".NET 2.0 Subset" to ".NET 2.0".
7)	Restart your Unity project.

8)	The values in MongoDB are accessed using the MongoInterface.Get*() syntax.
