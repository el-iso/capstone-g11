This document contains information about how to structure your file structure
under the in the Assets folder in a unity project. 

Package Exporting can be found in the unity editor under "Assets->ExportPackage"
Package Importing can be found under "Assets->Import Package->CustomPackage"

The following file structure is necessary because we are using MongoDB in our project.
We all want to share assets that use the same scripts and DLL dependencies, but the 
unity exporter appears to use relative paths to find things.  To solve this, we have
created a unity package called MongoDrivers.  
This package also contains our MongoInterface.cs script and a prefab object which can 
be used to reference the script. (THIS SYSTEM WILL CHANGE VERY SOON)



File Structure:
>Assets
================From MongoDrivers Package=================
>>Mongo
>>>MongoDrivers
>>>MongoScripts
>>>MongoPrefab
==================Your Package============================
>>YourPackageName
>>>YourAssets (Probably folders like Scripts, Materials, Prefabs, etc.)

Make sure you always reference Mongo using the assets in the MongoDrivers package, or
we won't be able to guarantee it will work when we try to merge into the master project.
