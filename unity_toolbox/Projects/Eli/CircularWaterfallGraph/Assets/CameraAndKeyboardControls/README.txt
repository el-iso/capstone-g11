This package requires inputs to be set up in a very specific way,
and I can't figure out a way to script it, so we're doing this 
the manual way.

1. Go to the Input Manager (Edit->Project Settings->Input)
2. Expand the Axes menu (should be the only thing in the list)
3. Change the name of "Vertical" to "Forward"
	a. NOTE THE CAPITALIZATION
4. Change the "Size" value from 18 to 22
5. Change the name of the first axis you just added to "Vertical"
	a. Set the "Negative Button" to f
	b. Set the "Positive Button" to r
6. Change the name of the second axis to "Yaw"
	a. Set the "Negative Button" to q
	b. Set the "Positive Button" to e
7. Change the name of the third axis to "Pitch"
	a. Set the "Negative Button" to t
	b. Set the "Positive Button" to g
8. Change the name of the fourth axis to "Roll"
	a. Set the "Negative Button" to z
	b. Set the "Positive Button" to x
